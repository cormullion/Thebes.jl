# The northernmost and oldest pyramid of the group was built
# for Khufu (Greek: Cheops), the second king of the 4th
# dynasty. Called the Great Pyramid, it is the largest of
# the three, the length of each side at the base averaging
# 755.75 feet (230 metres) and its original height being
# 481.4 feet (147 metres).

# The middle pyramid was built for Khafre (Greek:
# Chephren), the fourth of the eight kings of the 4th
# dynasty; the structure measures 707.75 feet (216
# metres) on each side and was originally 471 feet (143
# metres) high.

# The southernmost and last pyramid to be built was that
# of Menkaure (Greek: Mykerinus), the fifth king of the
# 4th dynasty; each side measures 356.5 feet (109
# metres), and the structureâ€™s completed height was 218
# feet (66 metres).
