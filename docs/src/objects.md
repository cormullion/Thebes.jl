# Objects

So far we've been drawing individual points and lines. This gets tiresome when you have a lot of them. Fortunately, Thebes has a few features for handling larger groups of points.

## Making objects

You make a 3D object using `make()`, and then use `pin()` to throw it onto the 2D drawing.

`make()` expects an array of 3D points, an (optional) array of face definitions, and an (optional) array of labels, plus an (optional) name. These arrays let you link faces with vertices. It returns an Object.

A Cube object is already defined in Thebes (we needn't have made one earlier, really). So after:

```
cube = make(Cube, "cube")
```

the `cube` variable contains:

```
Object(
    Point3D[
        Point3D(-0.5, 0.5, -0.5),
        Point3D(0.5, 0.5, -0.5),
        Point3D(0.5, -0.5, -0.5),
        Point3D(-0.5, -0.5, -0.5),
        Point3D(-0.5, 0.5, 0.5),
        Point3D(0.5, 0.5, 0.5),
        Point3D(0.5, -0.5, 0.5),
        Point3D(-0.5, -0.5, 0.5)
    ],

    [[1, 2, 3, 4],
     [2, 6, 7, 3],
     [6, 5, 8, 7],
     [5, 1, 4, 8],
     [1, 5, 6, 2],
     [4, 3, 7, 8]],

     [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],

     "cube")
```

The default rendering applied by `pin()` is an attempt at a simple hidden-surface display. In real 3D software, this process has to be far more sophisticated.

```@example
using Thebes, Luxor # hide
Drawing(600, 300, "assets/figures/simplecubeobject.svg") # hide
background("white") # hide
origin() # hide
helloworld() # hide

eyepoint(10, 10, 10)
perspective(3000)
cube = make(Cube, "cube")
pin(cube)

finish() # hide
nothing # hide
```

![simple cube object](assets/figures/simplecubeobject.svg)

Here's a very simple example of how you might make your own object from scratch.

```@example
using Thebes, Luxor # hide
Drawing(600, 300, "assets/figures/object1.svg") # hide
background("white") # hide
origin() # hide
helloworld() # hide

tol = 0.001
a = Point3D[]
for t in -2pi:tol:2pi
    push!(a, Point3D((100 + cos(5t)) * cos(3t), (100 + cos(5t)) * sin(2t), sin(5t)))
end
sethue("darkorange")
knot = make([a, []], "knot")

pin(knot, gfunction = (o) -> poly(objecttopoly(o)[1], :stroke))

finish() # hide
nothing # hide
```

![point example](assets/figures/object1.svg)

The `objecttopoly()` function returns a tuple, containing the 2D vertices, and the polygons that define the faces.

## OFF the shelf objects

Obviously this isn't something you'd want to do "by hand" very often. Fortunately there are plenty of people who are prepared to make 3D objects and distribute them in standard file formats, via the internet. Thebes.jl knows about one of these formats, the [Object File Format (.OFF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OFF_(file_format)). So there are a few objects already available for you to use directly.

## Using objects

The following objects are preloaded (from `data/objects.jl`) when Thebes.jl starts:

- Cube
- Tetrahedron
- Pyramid
- Teapot

```@example
using Thebes, Luxor # hide
Drawing(800, 300, "assets/figures/moreobjects.svg") # hide
background("white") # hide
origin() # hide
sethue("blue") # hide
helloworld() # hide

t = Tiler(600, 300, 2, 2)
setline(0.5)
for (n, o) in enumerate([Cube, Tetrahedron, Pyramid, Teapot])
    @layer begin
        translate(first.(t)[n])
        object = make(o, string(o))
        scaleby!(object, 80, 80, 80)
        pin(object)
    end
end

finish() # hide
nothing # hide
```

![more objects](assets/figures/moreobjects.svg)

```@example
using Thebes, Luxor # hide
Drawing(800, 300, "assets/figures/teapot.svg") # hide
background("white") # hide
origin() # hide
helloworld()
axes3D(200)
teapot = make(Teapot)
setline(0.5)
scaleby!(teapot, 100, 100, 100)
pin(teapot, gfunction=wireframe)
finish() # hide
nothing # hide

```

![teapot](assets/figures/teapot.svg)

You can load a few more objects by including the `moreobjects.jl` file:

```
include(dirname(dirname(pathof(Thebes))) * "/data/moreobjects.jl")
```

which brings these objects into play:

`boxcube` `boxtorus` `concave` `cone` `crossshape` `cube` `cuboctahedron` `dodecahedron` `geodesic` `helix2` `icosahedron` `icosidodecahedron` `octahedron` `octtorus` `rhombicosidodecahedron` `rhombicuboctahedron` `rhombitruncated_cubeoctahedron` `rhombitruncated_icosidodecahedron` `snub_cube` `snub_dodecahedron` `sphere2` `tet3d` `tetrahedron` `triangle` `truncated_cube` `truncated_dodecahedron` `truncated_icosahedron` `truncated_octahedron` `truncated_tetrahedron`

## Rendering objects

To render objects, there are many choices you can make about how to draw the faces and the vertices.

### Using gfunctions

You do this with a gfunction.

Here's a simple example:

```@example
using Thebes, Luxor # hide

include(dirname(pathof(Thebes)) * "/../data/moreobjects.jl")

Drawing(600, 600, "assets/figures/geodesic.svg") # hide
background("white") # hide
origin() # hide
sethue("blue") # hide
helloworld() # hide
setlinejoin("bevel")
eyepoint(150, 150, 150)

function mygfunction(o::Object)
    cols = [Luxor.julia_green, Luxor.julia_red, Luxor.julia_purple, Luxor.julia_blue]
    sortfaces!(o)
    if !isempty(o.faces)
        @layer begin
            for (n, face) in enumerate(o.faces)
                @layer begin
                    vertices = o.vertices[face]
                    sn = surfacenormal(vertices)
                    ang = anglebetweenvectors(sn, eyepoint())
                    sethue(cols[mod1(n, end)])
                    pin(vertices, gfunction = (p3, p2) ->
                        begin
                            poly(p2, :fill)
                            sethue("gold")
                            poly(p2, :stroke, close=true)
                        end)
                end
            end
        end
    end
    setcolor("gold3")
    pin.(o.vertices, gfunction = (p3, p2) -> begin
        setopacity(1)
        circle(p2, 2, :fill)
        end)
end

object = make(geodesic, "geodesic")
setopacity(0.9)
setline(0.5)
pin(scaleby!(object, 200, 200, 200), gfunction = mygfunction)

finish() # hide
nothing # hide
```

![geodesic](assets/figures/geodesic.svg)

## Faces

The faces are drawn in the order in which they were defined. But to be a more realistic 3D drawing, the faces should be drawn so that the ones nearest the viewer are drawn last, or better still, so that the ones that can't be seen aren't drawn at all.

!!! note

    This is why Thebes is more of a wireframe tool than any kind of genuine 3D application. Use Makie.jl. Or program Blender with Julia.

In theory it's possible to do some quick calculations on an object to sort the faces into the correct order for a particular viewpoint. The `sortfaces!()` function used above can do this for simple objects - it may be sufficient.

## Using custom code

Thebes.jl is a work in progress, and a good general-purpose rendering function that draws everything with lots of optional parameters is not yet provided. However, you can avoid using the built-in `pin(o::Object)` function, and experiment with code such as the following:

```@example
using Luxor, Thebes, Colors, ColorSchemes

include(dirname(pathof(Thebes)) * "/../data/moreobjects.jl")

function lighten(col::Colorant, f)
    c = convert(RGB, col)
    return RGB(f * c.r, f* c.g, f * c.b)
end

function drawobject(o;
        color=colorant"red")
    setlinejoin("bevel")
    if !isempty(o.faces)
        @layer begin
            for (n, f) in enumerate(o.faces)
                vs = o.vertices[f]
                sn = surfacenormal(vs)
                ang = anglebetweenvectors(sn, eyepoint())
                sl = slope(O, vs[1])
                sethue(lighten(color, rescale(ang, 0, Ï€, -2, 2)))
                pin(vs, gfunction = (p3, p2) -> begin
                    poly(p2, :fill)
                    sethue("grey30")
                    poly(p2, :stroke)
                end)
            end
        end
    end
end

function sphere(size, origin, color)
    s1 = make(sphere2)
    scaleby!(s1, size, size, size)
    moveby!(s1, origin)
    sortfaces!(s1)
    drawobject(s1, color=color)
end

function main()
    Drawing(500, 500, "assets/figures/juliaspheres.svg")
    background("grey20")
    origin()
    helloworld()
    eyepoint(300, 300, 300)
    perspective(450)
    setline(.5)
    sphere(90, Point3D(150, 0, 0), RGB(Luxor.julia_red...))
    sphere(90, Point3D(0, 150, 0), RGB(Luxor.julia_purple...))
    sphere(90, Point3D(0, 0, 150), RGB(Luxor.julia_green...))
    finish()
end

main()
nothing # hide
```
